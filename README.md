# Introduction
Welcome to my AR artwork.<br>
Since the previous version of directory is broken, there is only apk. file can work. Thus, I just put it on github.<br>
You are able to download the apk. file and transport to your own android phone.<br>
And then, make your camera focus on the picture sample stored in Picture directory.<br>
A Minions will Appear In Your World!<br>
 
The following is a sample. It's awesome, right?.<br>
You can attempt to interact with the button in the air, something will happen.<br>
Finally, I hope that you have a good time to enjoy it~.<br>
